# THDMMinimizer

Project for discovering parameters values in the THDM for which there exists
simultaneous charge-breaking and EW minima of the one-loop effective potential.

Final results of the scans we performed which yield counterexamples and
positive tree-level masses are stored in the `data` directory. The figures use
in the paper are stored in the `figures` directory.
